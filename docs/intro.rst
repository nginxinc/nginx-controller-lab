Getting Started
===============

Please use the "**NGINX Controller Product Team Demo / Lab**" Blueprint for this lab exercise

The infrastructure is all ready for you.
Controller, NGINX Plus, and agents are all installed. Controller is pre-configured.

The JumpHost contains a Postman collection that will be used for the demo. The Postman collection is organized as a number of steps within a workflow and the settings in the JSON body can be used through either the GUI or the API.

.. note::
    
    All work for this lab will be performed exclusively from the Windows
    jumphost. No installation or interaction with your local system is
    required
