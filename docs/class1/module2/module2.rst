Module 2 - ADC Application Workflows
=========================================

One of the primary use cases for NGINX Controller is providing ADC services to modern applications.
In this section, we will cover the concepts used in Controller's "app-centric" view of applications.

In Lab 1, students will walk through an app deployment in the Controller UI. 
In Lab 2, students will deploy an application through postman to represent how a customer might integrate Controller application deployments in a CI/CD pipeline.
In Lab 3, students will configure and test various "advanced ADC features" like URI rewrites and HTTP header manipulation which were previously only available as NGINX configuration directives.
In Lab 4, students will configure a TCP proxy / load balancer.
In Lab 5, students will configure a Gateway with a specific Listen IP and define a related Component.
In Lab 6, students will launch security event load generation in preparation of Module 3 and 4.
