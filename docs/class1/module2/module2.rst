Module 2 - ADC Application Workflows
=========================================

One of the primary use cases for NGINX Controller is providing ADC services to modern applications.
In this section, we will cover the concepts used in Controller's "app-centric" view of applications.

In Lab 1, students will walk through an app deployment in the Controller GUI. 
In Lab 2, students will deploy an application through postman to represent how a customer might integrate Controller application deployments in a CI/CD pipeline.
In Lab 3, students will configure and test various "advanced ADC features" like URI rewrites and HTTP header manipulation which were previously only available as NGINX configuration directives.
