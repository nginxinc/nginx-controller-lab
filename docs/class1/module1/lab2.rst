| Samantha owns the trading app: it's been extremely successful and rapidly adopted by retail |
| customers. Dev teams are rolling out new parts of the app using modern app processes like   |
| automated testing and CI/CD. We're going to deploy some new features for the app:           |
|                                                                                             |

|  - a referrals program, and                                                                 |

| Davidâ€™s team established the trading gateway for Samantha to support this new component.    |
| The Controller UI is both flexible and powerful, whether trying to understand what an app's |
| components are or doing app-based URI or SNI routing, or a combination.                     |
| What we're doing here is routing to the servers running the code: the `workload` group. A   |
| Workload Group is a section of servers or upstreams. Controller is responsible for applying |
| the configuration entered through the GUI or API, and realizing it at the actual NGINX      |
| instance to process traffic.                                                                |

+=============================================================================================+
| You were able to establish a new traffic path configuration and didn't have to directly     |
| configure an NGINX instance or understand nginx.conf. Through Controller's monitoring and   |
| analytics you can see this new component, ready and able to add value to the business unit  |
| and to their customers.                                                                     |

+=============================================================================================+
| Samantha explored Controller and discovered what she can do in the GUI. But she's most      |
| likely going to go forwards by adding these steps and configurations into her pipeline.     |
| We're now going to open a tool that Olivia might use to extend the trading app via the API. |

Login as Samantha using the API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1. From the desktop open Postman
    2. the Collection `NGINX Controller 3.0 UDF Demo & Lab` should already be loaded

 |open|
 
    4. Select `Login to Controller - retail dev`
 
 |login|
    
    5. Select `Send`

      You are now logged into the API as Samantha.  Controller returned a cookie that will be used for authenticating then executing the following commands.


Enable the Referrals capability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1. In Postman open the section `Retail-Dev Environment` 
    2. open the `Application - trading.acmefinancial.com` section

     |trading|

    4. In the right hand frame of Postman, select the `Body` tab

     |body|

   .. NOTE::
      The command's output shows Controller's several pods are distributed among the three nodes (the "NODE" column).

Additional Reference
--------------------
Future NGINX Controller releases will allow for the creation of a floating self-ip by adding a "load balancer" to the
exposed API Gateway ("apigw") kubernetes service. For on-premise installations `MetalLB`_ handle L2 failover. 
For cloud installations a k8s service with type `LoadBalancer`_, resulting in a cloud native external load balancer, will be used.
