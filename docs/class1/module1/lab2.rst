| Samantha owns the trading app: it's been extremely successful and rapidly adopted by retail |
| customers. Dev teams are rolling out new parts of the app using modern app processes like   |
| automated testing and CI/CD. We're going to deploy some new features for the app:           |
|                                                                                             |
|  - the ability to transfer funds,                                                           |
|  - a referrals program, and                                                                 |
|  - file uploads                                                                             |

| Davidâ€™s team established the trading gateway for Samantha to support this new component.    |
| The Controller UI is both flexible and powerful, whether trying to understand what an app's |
| components are or doing app-based URI or SNI routing, or a combination.                     |
| What we're doing here is routing to the servers running the code: the `workload` group. A   |
| Workload Group is a section of servers or upstreams. Controller is responsible for applying |
| the configuration entered through the GUI or API, and realizing it at the actual NGINX      |
| instance to process traffic.                                                                |

Review the new section of the Trading application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1. Return to the trading application browser tab and refresh the page
    2. Note the new capability that has been added to the right hand side of the application.

+=============================================================================================+
| You were able to establish a new traffic path configuration and didn't have to directly     |
| configure an NGINX instance or understand nginx.conf. Through Controller's monitoring and   |
| analytics you can see this new component, ready and able to add value to the business unit  |
| and to their customers.                                                                     |

| Samantha explored Controller and discovered what she can do in the GUI. But she's most      |
| likely going to go forwards by adding these steps and configurations into her pipeline.     |
| We're now going to open a tool that Olivia might use to extend the trading app via the API. |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Login as Samantha using the API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1. From the desktop open Postman
    2. the Collection `NGINX Controller 3.0 UDF Demo & Lab` should already be loaded
    3. Open the `Common Tasks` section 
    
 |open|
 
    4. Select `Login to Controller - retail dev`
 
 |login|
    
    5. Select `Send`

      You are now logged into the API as Samantha.  Controller returned a cookie that will be used for authenticating then executing the following commands.


Enable the Referrals capability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1. In Postman open the section `Retail-Dev Environment` 
    2. open the `Application - trading.acmefinancial.com` section
    3. Select `Create Comp - trading - referrals`

     |trading|

    4. In the right hand frame of Postman, select the `Body` tab

     |body|

    5. Review the JSON
    6. Make sure that the method is set to "PUT"

     |method|
      
    7. Click `Send`
    8. Change the method to "GET" and click `Send` again
    
    
    9. View the status of the configuration being applied in the `currentStatus` section and that the `selfConfigState` is in "configuring"
    10. Repeat the GET until "configured" equals "1"
    
      |configured|

+=============================================================================================+
| Controller follows an *API-First* methodology, which means that what you see in the GUI is  |
| using the very same APIs Controller provides.                                               |
| In the pervious PUT request's body you can see the desiredState for ingress (the incoming   |
| URI) and backend (the workload groups and servers). Through the GET request you can see the |
| *eventually consistent* behavior of the system as the config is built and then applied to   |
| the specified NGINX instance.                                                               |
