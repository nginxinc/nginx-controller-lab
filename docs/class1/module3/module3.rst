Module 3 - Analytics
================================

In this section, students will walk through Controller Analytics from the perspective of two different personas, NetOps and DevOps.

In Lab 1, students will explore NGINX Plus instance statistics provided by NGINX Controller.
In Lab 2, students will explore the rich app and WAF analytics provided by Controller when the Controller App Security (CAS) is licensed and enabled.

.. IMPORTANT::
   - Please ensure you have started the load generator, outlined in Module 2 Lab 6 (:ref:`loadgen`), so you have analytics to view in this lab.
