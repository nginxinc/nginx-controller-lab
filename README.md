NGINX Controller Lab Guide
==========================

![Build Docs](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-controller-lab/workflows/Build%20Docs/badge.svg)

Introduction
------------

This repo contains the documentation sources for the NGINX Controller 3.x UDF lab. Tarball builds of the html build output are also available as Releases. GitHub Actions builds the documentation on each Pull Request. A Push to the `main` branch will both build the documentation and create a Release.

Setup
-----

1. Download or `git clone` the nginx-controller-lab
2. Download and install Docker CE (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
3. Build the sample docs `./containthedocs-build.sh`. The first time you build
   a container (~1G in size) will be downloaded from Docker Hub.
4. Open the `docs/_build/html/index.html` file on you system in a web browser


Build Scripts

The repo includes build scripts for common operations:

- `containthedocs-bash.sh`: Run to container with a BASH prompt
